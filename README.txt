Partial code base from a 3d pong game I worked on with my partner Sean McBeth during my spring 2012 semester at UT austin. The project was completed using the OGRE 3d graphics
engine on Linux. We created a 3d pong game with multiple levels, a boss stage, and networked 2 person multiplayer. My responsibiliies included creating the UI, user controls, 
networking, and sound.
